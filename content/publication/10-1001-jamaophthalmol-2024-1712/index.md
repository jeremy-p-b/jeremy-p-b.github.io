abstract: Fluoroquinolone use has been associated with increased risk of uveitis and
  retinal detachment in noninterventional studies, but the findings have been conflicting
  and causality is unclear. To estimate the association of systemic fluoroquinolone
  use with acute uveitis or retinal detachment, using multiple analyses and multiple
  databases to increase the robustness of results. This cohort study used data from
  the Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum and GOLD UK primary care records databases,
  which were linked to hospital admissions data. Adults prescribed a fluoroquinolone
  or a comparator antibiotic, cephalosporin, between April 1997 and December 2019
  were included. Adults with uveitis or retinal detachment were analyzed in a separate
  self-controlled case series. Data analysis was performed from May 2022 to May 2023.
  Systemic fluoroquinolone or comparator antibiotic. The primary outcome was a diagnosis
  of acute uveitis or retinal detachment. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated in the
  cohort study for the association of fluoroquinolone prescription with either uveitis
  or retinal detachment, using stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighted
  Cox regression. Rate ratios (RRs) were estimated in the self-controlled case series,
  using conditional Poisson regression. Estimates were pooled across databases using
  fixed-effects meta-analysis. In total, 3 001 256 individuals in Aurum (1 893 561
  women [63.1%]; median [IQR] age, 51 [35-68] years) and 434 754 in GOLD (276 259
  women [63.5%]; median [IQR] age, 53 [37-70] years) were included in the cohort study.
  For uveitis, the pooled adjusted HRs (aHRs) for use of fluoroquinolone vs cephalosporin
  were 0.91 (95% CI, 0.72-1.14) at first treatment episode and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.92-1.25)
  over all treatment episodes. For retinal detachment, the pooled aHRs were 1.37 (95%
  CI, 0.80-2.36) at first treatment episode and 1.18 (95% CI, 0.84-1.65) over all
  treatment episodes. In the self-controlled case series, for uveitis, the pooled
  adjusted RRs (aRRs) for fluoroquinolone use vs nonuse were 1.13 (95% CI, 0.97-1.31)
  for 1 to 29 days of exposure, 1.16 (95% CI, 1.00-1.34) for 30 to 59 days, and 0.98
  (95% CI, 0.74-1.31) for 60 days for longer. For retinal detachment, pooled aRRs
  for fluoroquinolone use vs nonuse were 1.15 (95% CI, 0.86-1.54) for 1 to 29 days
  of exposure, 0.94 (95% CI, 0.69-1.30) for 30 to 59 days, and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.59-1.78)
  for 60 days or longer. These findings do not support an association of systemic
  fluoroquinolone use with substantively increased risk of uveitis or retinal detachment.
  Although an association cannot be completely ruled out, these findings indicate
  that any absolute increase in risk would be small and, hence, of limited clinical
  importance.
