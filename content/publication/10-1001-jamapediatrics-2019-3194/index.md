abstract: Young relative age within the school year has previously been associated
  with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis and, based on limited
  evidence, diagnosis of intellectual disability. No study to date has examined the
  association between relative age and diagnosis of depression. To estimate the associations
  with intellectual disability and ADHD and investigate a potential novel association
  between relative age and childhood depression. This population-based cohort study
  of 1 042 106 children aged 4 to 15 years used electronic record data collected before
  January 3, 2017, from more than 700 general practices contributing to the UK Clinical
  Practice Research Datalink. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression modeling
  was used to explore the association between relative age and the incidence of intellectual
  disability, ADHD, and depression before age 16 years. Data were analyzed between
  July 2017 and January 2019. Relative age within school year determined by month
  of birth and categorized into four 3-month groups. Intellectual disability, ADHD,
  and depression. In the total cohort of 1 042 106 children, 532 876 were male (51.1%)
  and the median age at study entry was 4.0 years (interquartile range, 4.0-5.0).
  There was evidence that being born in the last quarter of the school year (ie, being
  the youngest group in a school year) was associated with diagnosis of intellectual
  disability (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.30; 95% CI, 1.18-1.42), ADHD (aHR, 1.36;
  95% CI, 1.28-1.45), and depression (aHR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08-1.59) compared with
  being born in the first quarter. A graded association was seen with intermediate
  age groups at a smaller increased risk of each diagnosis compared with the oldest
  group, with aHRs for intellectual disability for those born in the second quarter
  of 1.06 (95% CI, 0.96-1.17) and for those born in the third quarter of 1.20 (95%
  CI, 1.09-1.32); aHRs for ADHD for those born in the second quarter of 1.15 (95%
  CI, 1.08-1.23) and for those born in the third quarter of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.23-1.40);
  and aHRs for depression for those born in the second quarter of 1.05 (95% CI, 0.85-1.29)
  and for those born in the third quarter of 1.13 (95% CI, 0.92-1.38). In this study,
  relative youth status in the school year is associated with an increased risk of
  diagnosis of ADHD, intellectual disability, and depression in childhood. Further
  research into clinical and policy interventions to minimize these associations appears
  to be needed.
