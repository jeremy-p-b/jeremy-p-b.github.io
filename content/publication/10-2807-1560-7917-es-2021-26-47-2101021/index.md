abstract: 'Since December 2019, over 1.5 million SARS-CoV-2-related fatalities have
  been recorded in the World Health Organization European Region - 90.2% in people
  ≥ 60 years. We calculated lives saved in this age group by COVID-19 vaccination
  in 33 countries from December 2020 to November 2021, using weekly reported deaths
  and vaccination coverage. We estimated that vaccination averted 469,186 deaths (51%
  of 911,302 expected deaths; sensitivity range: 129,851–733,744; 23–62%). Impact
  by country ranged 6–93%, largest when implementation was early.'
