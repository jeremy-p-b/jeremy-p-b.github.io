abstract: 'To investigate the association between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and
  both all‐cause and cause‐specific mortality. We conducted a cohort study using the
  UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD database. We compared 733 885 new users
  of PPIs to 124 410 new users of H2 receptor antagonists (H2Ras). In a secondary
  analysis we compared 689 602 PPI new users to 1 361 245 nonusers of acid suppression
  therapy matched on age, sex and calendar year. Hazard ratios for all‐cause and cause‐specific
  mortality were estimated using propensity score (PS) weighted Cox models. PPI prescription
  was associated with increased risk of all‐cause mortality, with hazard ratios decreasing
  considerably by increasing adjustment (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.65, 95% confidence
  interval [CI] 1.62‐1.69; PS‐weighted HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.33‐1.44; high‐dimensional
  PS‐weighted HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.26‐1.37). Short‐term associations were observed with
  mortality from causes where a causal short‐term association is unexpected (eg, lung
  cancer mortality: PS‐weighted HR at 6 months 1.77, 95% CI 1.39‐2.25). Adjusted hazard
  ratios were substantially higher when compared to nonusers (PS‐weighted HR all‐cause
  mortality 1.96, 95% CI 1.94‐1.99) rather than H2RA users. PPI prescription was strongly
  associated with all‐cause and cause‐specific mortality. However, the change in hazard
  ratios (a) by increasing adjustment and (b) between comparator groups indicates
  that residual confounding is likely to explain the association between poor health
  outcomes and PPI use, and fully accounting for this using observational data may
  not be possible.'
